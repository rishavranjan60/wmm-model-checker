-----
In TSO, the Release (REL) and Acquire (ACQ) operations provide ordering
such that if one thread sees y = 1, it is obliged to see x = 1 as well

1) TSO guarantees that if thread t2 has seen y = 1, it is bound to see x = 1 as well

2) The order store REL(x); store REL(y) must be preserved when loading load ACQ(y); load ACQ(x)

3) If r11 == 1 but r10 == 0, it means that t2 saw y = 1 but did not see x = 1, which is forbidden in TSO.
In this case the test goes to fail
