-----
In TSO, stores are done in a single global order, if one thread writes x = 1 and y = 1,
another thread cannot see y = 1 but x = 0

1) TSO guarantees that if y = 1 is visible to another thread, then x = 1 is also visible to it

2) If r11 == 1 (thread t2 saw y = 1), it is bound to see x = 1 as well

3) If r10 == 0, then the global order of records has been violated, fail is called
